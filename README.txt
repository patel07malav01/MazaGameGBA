M A Z E  !!!


This is a MAZE game for smart players!!! You have to reach to the middle of the 
target within 30 seconds of the start. Otherwise, you lose the game and the BIGGGG fame!!!

RULES:: 

 1. If you hit any of the pillars, then you lose the game. 
    Exceptions: You can hit the walls any number of time you want. 
    (This was done to follow the randomness of the space assigned.)
 2. If you cross the time-limit of 30 seconds to finish the game, you lose the game as well.

 3. You only win when you climb onto the target image, and the win screen is displayed. 


*** Pay attention to the size of the ball and the space between the pillars. 
    If you accidently hit even the corner of the pillar, you lose the game.
